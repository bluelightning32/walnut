Build the project:
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ../
  make -j4

Walnut is a library for performing 3D boolean operations. It also contains an
optional library that wraps the algorithm in a VTK filter, along with some
examples of how to use the VTK filter. These parts can be excluded from the
build with the -DUSE_VTK=OFF option to cmake.

The -L option lists other common options.
  cmake ../ -L

For regular development, a debug release type is recommended. The debug release has the asserts enabled, and it has full debug symbols.
  cmake ../ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
