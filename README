Build the project:
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ../
  make -j4

The project has some algorithm visualizations to help illustrate how the
alogrithm works in specific examples. To build them, run the following command
from the build directory. The visualization programs will be written
build/visualizations.
  make -j4 visualizations

The -L option lists other common options.
  cmake ../ -L

For regular development, a debug release type is recommended. The debug release has the asserts enabled, and it has full debug symbols.
  cmake ../ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

After making a change to the library, everything can be built and all the tests
run with this command:
  make -j4 all extras
