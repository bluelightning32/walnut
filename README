Build the project:
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ../
  make -j4

The project has some algorithm visualizations to help illustrate how the
alogrithm works in specific examples. To build them, run the following command
from the build directory. The visualization programs will be written
build/visualizations.
  make -j4 visualizations

The -L option lists other common options.
  cmake ../ -L

When making changes to the library, you can built really everything (including
optional features such as the visualizations) by running:
  make -j4 all extras
